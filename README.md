# Asymmetric Cyptography
GUI-based implementation of four asymmetric cryptography in C++. The implemented encryptions are
1. **RSA** (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
2. **ElGamal**
3. **Paillier**
4. **ECC** (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), specifically Elliptic Curve ElGamal

## Required Library
**Qt5** and **GNU Multiple Precision** (GMP) is required in order to compile and run this library.
